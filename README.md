### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology with a strong focus on Software Development, Data Streaming, and Web development. My thread at the Institute is Intelligence and Info/Internetwork. I am an excellent team player and a quick learner. Tasked with a job, I can see myself delivering results beyond expectations.
